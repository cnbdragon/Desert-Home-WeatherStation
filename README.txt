Desert-Home-WeatherStation
===========
The Weather Station software I use to receive from the RF transmitter
on a AcuRite 5n1 sensor up on my roof. Data is saved to a MySQL data base
and retrieved from there for presentation or use by another process

This requires the slightly modified rtl_433 driver in Desert-Home-rtl_433
to read the RF signal.
